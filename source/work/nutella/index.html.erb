        Seven Ounces is a web app that helps users find new and exciting ways to add Nutella into their everyday lives. Users can search nearby locations that serve Nutella or find a great recipe to make at home. I participated in all aspects of the site development and design, with a focus on visual design, user experience, and frontend development. The styling is implemented with Twitter Bootstrap, SCSS, and CSS3, and the app is built with Ruby on Rails and jQuery, and deployed to Heroku.
